## Installation
    
In order to use this application, you must first have the Node.JS program installed onto your local machine. After that, simply download and install the package called Inquirer. This is accomplished by using gitbash and typing the command 'npm init -y'. If a package.json file is installed, you have successfully installed the Inquirer package. 
    
## Usage
    
After the package.json file is in your repository, you can install it to your project by typing 'npm i inquirer'. After this is done, you will be able to type in the command 'node index.js'. This will start the series of prompts for the user to answer and begin building the desired README.md file. Upon seeing gitbash say 'successful' at the end of the prompts, you will have successfully created your own README using this application.
